# Decision History

## 2026-07-11 - Repository-wide work requires a fetched remote-ancestry preflight

Decision: Treat remote freshness as an explicit prerequisite for broad audits,
optimizations, migrations, history rewrites, and repository splits. The
incident that established this rule began with local work based on `348aa9f`
while remote `main` had advanced to `40a27b8`. No fetch/ancestry preflight ran
before the audit and optimization, so comprehensive tests proved the stale
tree internally consistent but could not detect the newer remote architecture.
The requirement did not change; the workflow omitted a source-of-truth check.

The durable guardrail is `scripts/check_repository_freshness.py`. It fetches
the selected remote without changing working-tree files, compares local HEAD
and the remote branch through their merge base, and reports `current`, `ahead`,
`behind`, `diverged`, `dirty-on-stale-base`, or `remote-unavailable`. A dirty
stale checkout is preserved and reconciled from an isolated remote-fresh clone;
it is never reset, rebased, stashed, cleaned, or overwritten to satisfy the
check. Its behavioral self-test uses real repositories and remotes to prove all
six classifications, including dirty-file preservation and false-positive
controls for current dirty work and legitimately ahead branches. Root
validation runs that self-test so the preflight cannot silently disappear.

## 2026-07-07 - DevOps Console: single-row header with a needs-attention badge; uniform color-coded actions (v1.5.1)

Decision: Two user requests shipped together. (1) Projects page action
alignment: project-header rows rendered Start/Restart/Stop while item rows
rendered Stop/Restart (or a lone Start), so right-aligned buttons landed in
mismatched columns. Every tree row now renders the SAME three fixed-width
(86px) slots through one `treeActionSlots` builder — Start | Restart | Stop,
inapplicable actions disabled with a title, never hidden — so buttons align
into exact columns (playwright-verified: one left-X per label on desktop and
phone). Actions are color-coded console-wide via `ACTION_CLS` — Start green,
Restart blue, Stop red, disabled drops to neutral so color always means
"available" — and the Servers/Docker pages adopted the same Restart-before-
Stop order. (2) Header reimagined: the status sentence and always-on
coordinator/TLS/dev-http chips are gone; the header is brand + inline nav
tabs (≥1024px; hamburger drawer that DROPS BELOW the row on narrower
screens) + a needs-attention badge + a compact account button (avatar
initial → popover with email + sign out) — ONE row on every viewport
(48px desktop, 54px phone, domain label hidden <480px; playwright-verified
one-row geometry + zero horizontal scroll). A quiet header means healthy:
`headerProblems()` collects coordinator-unreachable (red), TLS
expired/expiring<14d/unknown, insecure dev HTTP, unhealthy servers,
unresolving routes, docker down, and stale live data; the badge shows the
count in the worst severity color and its popover gives each problem facts,
a plain-language instruction and a direct action (Try again / Open page /
copyable `sudo certbot renew` / Refresh now). The stale-data path was
exercised end-to-end in a real browser (network cut → amber badge "1" →
popover names the problem with Refresh action → badge clears on recovery).
journeys.md J1, the information-relevance rows and the status-summary
interpretation were rewritten for badge semantics; validate.py pins
headerProblems/hdr-alert/treeActionSlots/ACTION_CLS. Residual: on the narrow
(<1100px) tree layout the container subdomain chip is hidden like
tree-detail (the tight cell wrapped it mid-word); subdomains remain fully
manageable on the Servers and Docker pages at every width.

## 2026-07-07 - DevOps Console: stable ordering contract — live metrics are never a sort key (v1.4.1)

Decision: User-reported incident, handled prevention-first. Symptom: project
groups on the Servers page (and Docker/Projects/Ports, which share
`projectGroupsOf`) changed position on every 6s poll, making targets
impossible to click. Reproduced at the data level against the live console:
three overview polls 7s apart, the v1.3.0 comparator (running-first, then
`cpu_percent` DESC, then name) flipped GlobalFinance/holyskills twice purely
on CPU jitter. Origin: the cpu tiebreak was added by the agent in the v1.3.0
projects-tree work as an unrequested "hot projects float up" flourish — the
user asked for grouping, never for load-ordered groups; no doc stated an
ordering contract, no test asserted order determinism, and three adversarial
review passes missed it (no lens asked "is ordering stable across polls?").
Guardrails first: docs/journeys.md gained a "Stable ordering contract"
acceptance criterion (live CPU/memory must never be an ordering key on
persistent lists; reorder only on state transitions, membership changes, or
user action); test/unit.uiorder.test.mjs extracts the comparator from app.js
and proves order is independent of cpu readings (mutation-verified: restoring
the old comparator fails all three tests); validate.py pins the comparator
(`projectGroupOrder` + its sort call site) and PROHIBITS the two live-metric
sort keys as needles. Fix: `projectGroupOrder` sorts running-first → name →
key (key breaks display-name collisions deterministically); the Performance
page's `lastCpu` card ordering — same class, found by the adjacent-surface
audit — became running-first → name → key too. The Swift board's
`hotProcesses` cpu sort was audited and kept: it selects top-5 content for a
label, it does not order persistent rows. Full validate ok; deployed and
verified stable across live polls.

## 2026-07-07 - DevOps Console: docker-hosted web servers are first-class servers (v1.4.0)

Decision: Containers that serve web traffic (the user's example:
`skydivelive-app-1`) now appear in the Servers list, can be
started/stopped/restarted there, and take subdomains like coordinator
servers. Membership rule: any non-database container publishing a TCP port
on a loopback-reachable address, plus stopped containers that still hold a
route (a stopped container publishes nothing, so the route is what keeps it
startable from the page). Subdomains use a new route kind `docker` whose
durable identity is container name + CONTAINER-side port; the published host
port is resolved live from the (cached) coordinator inventory on every
request, so restarts and remapped host ports keep working. One shared
subdomain control (spec-parametrized) serves server rows, docker rows, the
Docker tab and the Projects tree, growing a container-port picker when
several ports are published; `/api/docker/subdomain` mirrors the server
endpoint's assign/rename/auth/unassign semantics. Every resolved port —
docker included — passes the coordinator-API-port guard.

A five-lens adversarial review (57 agents, 24 confirmed findings, all fixed)
shaped the final design: v6-only publishes (`::`/`::1`) are now REJECTED as
unreachable because the proxy dials v4 loopback — a separate socket
namespace — so accepting them either 502s or cross-wires the route into
whatever unrelated v4 process holds that port number; same-slug updates
(auth changes, renames) no longer demand a currently-published port and
never silently repoint the stored container port (explicit `port` only, and
re-sending the route's own port is a no-op); paused containers
(`Up … (Paused)`) read as paused, not running, and their routes refuse to
proxy; the e2e docker-web fixture listener is closed in after() — leaving it
open wedged `node --test` after a green run, the exact hang class the macOS
CI work just fixed; an OS-assigned fixture port containing "5432" would have
silently reclassified the fixture as postgres (redrawn now). Coverage: e2e
tests 16–17 run a fake docker CLI under the real coordinator (assign →
proxied 200 through the TLS edge → actions logged → ambiguity/typo 400s →
stale-port lifecycle → idempotent unassign), and a drift test extracts the
UI's mirrored ports parser from app.js and runs it against the backend
parser over a shared corpus. Known residual, accepted: if several docker
routes point at one container (possible via the Routes form), the row
control manages the slug-sorted first — the same semantics server rows have
always had; extras are managed on the Routes page.

## 2026-07-07 - CI on macOS: never use bare `python3 -m http.server` as a test fixture

Decision: The repo's first full macOS CI runs exposed two independent
failures, both diagnosed by reproducing on the runner itself (a temporary
`debug-macos` probe workflow) rather than by guessing. (1) A cancelled-
after-30-minutes run was a HANG, not slowness: the e2e harness's coordinator
spawn missed its readiness window and the timeout path leaked the python
child, whose inherited stdio pipes kept the `node --test` worker alive
silently until the job timeout — every spawn-failure path now kills the
child, readiness gets 60s, and the workflow budget is 60 minutes. (2) With
the hang fixed, every coordinator-started fixture reported "unhealthy, pid
alive, port closed": the probe showed even a bare
`python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1 &` control never reaches listen()
on macos-latest — lsof shows the socket bound but stuck in CLOSED — because
`HTTPServer.server_bind` calls `socket.getfqdn()` and the runner's resolver
black-holes reverse DNS (`getfqdn('')`/`getfqdn(hostname)` hang 20s+; an
`/etc/hosts` entry does NOT cure it since macOS libinfo routes reverse
lookups through mDNSResponder). Policy: test fixtures must not use bare
`http.server`; the suites now share a getfqdn-free equivalent
(`socketserver.TCPServer` + `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` — same directory
listing, no name resolution; `HTTP_FIXTURE_CODE` in the coordinator
self-test, `PY_HTTP_FIXTURE` in the console e2e), verified answering 200 on
the same runner where `http.server` hangs. Also: `apiCall` in the console
e2e forwards fetch options and whole-project actions carry a 330s client
budget (the coordinator legitimately runs them for minutes). The "successful"
earlier run that suggested macOS had ever been green was only the Copilot
review job — the full gate had never passed on macOS before this.

Follow-up (same day): the fixture sweep missed that the hazard is any stdlib
`HTTPServer` construction, not just `-m http.server` fixtures — the next run
passed all 81 node tests and then failed in the coordinator self-test because
`serve_api` itself builds a stock `ThreadingHTTPServer`, which pays the same
~30s getfqdn stall between bind() and listen() (the console e2e only passed
because its readiness budget is 60s). Cure at the source: the coordinator API
now binds through `FastBindThreadingHTTPServer` (a `server_bind` override
that binds like a plain `socketserver.TCPServer` and skips reverse DNS),
pinned by validate needles; the coordinator and formal-web-ui self-test
in-process fixtures use the same override, and `wait_for_api` gets 30s of
cold-runner headroom. Generalized policy: on this repo, never construct a
stdlib `HTTPServer`/`ThreadingHTTPServer` (or `-m http.server`) directly in
anything CI runs — always the fast-bind subclass or a plain `TCPServer`.

## 2026-07-07 - validate.py de-staled: needles pin code and call sites, not comments and definitions

Decision: A two-auditor adversarial pass over the gate itself (prompted by the
user's "validate.py seems stale") confirmed 13 weaknesses; all fixed. Weak
anchors replaced or reinforced: the slug-enumeration needle matched only a
COMMENT — now pins `const needAuth = !route || route.auth !== 'public';`;
two different Swift invariants shared the identical needle
`GeometryReader { proxy in` (5 matches — neither was pinned) — now unique
anchors; definition-only needles gained call-site pins so deleting the wiring
fails the gate (autoUnhide's refreshOverview call, buildAssignments'
setSection wiring, setSurfaceVisible's window/popover call sites, OpsStore's
deduplicatedManagedServers load wiring); the ambiguous `.frame(width: 14)`
pin now includes its contentShape context. Coverage gaps closed:
test/helpers/dev-cert.mjs joined the haystack with an openssl-generation
needle (its generation branch never runs locally, so only the needle guards
CI); metrics usage_key-first keying pinned by needle AND a same-project_key
collision unit fixture; server.mjs drain-timer cleanup pinned; the verifier's
object-form cookies gained self-test recall (domain/path-scoped cookie
reaches a gated page) plus a fail-fast malformed-domain assertion; the
DevOpsConsole banned-marker scan now covers index.html and app.css;
Tools/SnapshotMain.swift joined the ops haystack (was outside every guard).
Verified by mutation: deleting the autoUnhide call site now fails the gate
(it was green before). Also removed the ended background session's stale
worktree (.claude/worktrees/festive-herschel-713bfa, a clean pre-rename
checkout). Full validate.py ok; formal-web-ui self-test ok.

## 2026-07-07 - DevOpsBoard: project grouping consumes coordinator membership instead of re-deriving it

Decision: Closed the follow-up from the same-day coordinator membership fix —
the Swift menu-bar app was the last UI re-deriving container→project grouping
client-side (`projectKey(fromResourceName:)` name-key heuristics plus a
`projectPathForGroup` ~/src directory scan), so it could show a container
under a group that differs from the membership `project start/restart/stop`
acts on (the exact divergence class just fixed for the web console). Fix:
`makeProjectGroups(from:)` now iterates inventory `project_usage` rows and
resolves members strictly through `server_ids`/`container_names`;
`ProjectGroup.id` is the row's `usage_key` (unique — `project_key` is a
display name), `projectPath` comes from `row.project` only (name-keyed
`name:<key>` groups get no synthesized action path, matching the coordinator
refusing whole-project actions on unclaimed containers), and anything no row
claims stays visible in a stray "other" fallback group like the web console's.
`ProjectUsage` decodes `usage_key`/`server_ids`/`container_names`;
`OpsStore.mergeProjectUsage` buckets multi-home inventories by `usage_key` and
unions membership. The heuristic family (`projectKey(fromPath:/
fromDockerContainer:/fromResourceName:)`, token sets, `projectDisplayName`,
`projectPathForGroup`) is deleted; `resourceDisplayName` survives as a
cosmetic leaf-prefix strip (now fed by the group display name, normalized
case-insensitively) and Docker/DB table project labels resolve through group
membership. The details-panel fallback for a selection that dropped out of
cached groups parses the persisted `usage_key` contract (`path:<resolved>`)
instead of scanning ~/src. Coverage: `SplitSizingTest` gained must-catch
fixtures per divergence class — sidecar-attributed `aerodb-pg` must display
under XFoilFOAM (not a name-derived `aerodb` group), coordinator-claimed
`grouprepo-db` must display under the path-keyed repo, an unclaimed
same-name-key container must stay OUT of the repo group whose actions do not
touch it, membership-less containers must stay visible in the stray group,
and every container must render exactly once. validate.py replaced the
heuristic needles ("canonical project grouping", "project path grouping",
"project panel path fallback") with membership pins (decoding keys, usage-key
identity, stray group, multi-home union, the three board must-catch strings)
and added prohibited needles for `projectKey(fromResourceName` /
`projectPathForGroup(` so the heuristics cannot quietly return. Verified via
the local needle gate; Swift compile + QA tools need the macOS CI leg (no
Swift toolchain on this box).

## 2026-07-07 - Coordinator: one container-membership model for display grouping and whole-project actions

Decision: Closed the follow-up gap from the same-day console review — display
membership (`build_project_usage`/`resource_project_identity`) and
whole-project action membership (`build_project_runtime_spec` via
`matching_project_containers`) could disagree: an unattributed container like
`myrepo-db` displayed under a name-keyed group `name:myrepo` (project null)
while `project stop` on the path-keyed repo stopped it, and a container
explicitly attributed elsewhere (Compose labels) was still name-matched into a
different repo's blast radius. Reproduced both through the CLI (fake docker +
durable pins) before changing code. Root cause: two independent attribution
implementations. Fix: a single `container_project_attribution(container,
known_projects)` used by both paths, fed by one claim set
(`known_project_paths`: state server records, durable port pins, container
label/sidecar projects, plus the action's target repo). Rules: explicit
attribution (Compose labels, then coordinator sidecar) always wins; a unique
name-key match claims an unattributed container for the known repo; an
ambiguous name key (several known repos) stays in its own `name:<key>` group
and no whole-project action touches it (previously EVERY matching repo's stop
would stop it). `project stop` now records sidecar attribution for containers
it acts on (start/restart already did via `ensure_runtime_docker_metadata` /
`run_docker`), so grouping converges to explicit membership after any
whole-project action. Console UI unchanged by design — it already groups by
`project_usage` `usage_key`/`server_ids`/`container_names`, which are now also
the action contract. Coverage: coordinator self-test gained three must-catch
membership classes (name-claim divergence, explicit-attribution leak,
ambiguity refusal) — each proven to fail against the pre-fix coordinator via a
reconstructed old-behavior copy with an expected-fail harness — plus
convergence and display guards; five new validate.py needles (attribution
function, shared claim set, ambiguity refusal, must-catch fixture, SKILL blast
radius contract); SKILL.md and DevOpsConsole docs/coordinator-http-api.json
now state the unified membership contract (inventory `project_usage` rows
document `usage_key`/`server_ids`/`container_names` and the claim rules;
projects/start|stop purposes name the attribution). Known residuals, accepted:
a DECLARED dependency whose container name does not match the repo key stays
name-grouped until the first whole-project action records its sidecar
attribution (display cannot see runtime files; reading every known repo's
declaration on each inventory was rejected as new I/O/failure surface), and
the Swift DevOpsBoard app still re-derives grouping client-side
(`projectKey(fromResourceName:)`) — filed as a follow-up task since this box
has no Swift toolchain to verify a rework. Full validate.py ok.

## 2026-07-07 - DevOps Console: Projects tree, repo grouping everywhere, hideable items that self-reveal

Decision: Made the console project-centric (v1.3.0). New default `#/projects`
page renders a tree of repos with everything that belongs to each: servers,
databases (docker.postgres), containers — per-item AND per-project live
CPU/mem numbers + sparklines, per-item start/stop/restart, and whole-project
Start/Restart/Stop through new `POST /api/projects/action` → coordinator
`/v1/projects/*` (dependencies before web servers, pinned ports preserved,
300s budget, stop/restart confirmed with blast radius named). Grouping is
authoritative, not guessed: `build_project_usage` rows now carry
`server_ids`/`container_names`/`usage_key` membership, so the console never
re-implements the coordinator's repo-identity heuristics; the Servers,
Docker and Ports pages group their rows under the same project headers (with
aggregate CPU/mem + project sparkline). Hiding: stopped servers/containers
and idle projects can be hidden; hidden keys (server identity key, container
name, project usage_key) persist server-side in `<stateDir>/ui-prefs.json`
via new `GET/PATCH /api/prefs` (validated lists, Origin-guarded, atomic
writes) so the preference follows the operator across devices; anything the
coordinator reports as running is auto-unhidden on the next poll
(`autoUnhide` fire-and-forget PATCH), and every page shows a "Show N hidden
items" reveal with per-row unhide — nothing active can stay hidden, nothing
hidden is unrecoverable. Tests: e2e 14 (prefs round-trip, dedupe/trim,
validation 400s, forged-Origin 403, persistence) and e2e 15 (real
dev-runtime project started/stopped through the console; membership asserted
via server_ids) — suite 75/75 twice; coordinator self-test asserts the new
membership fields; four new validate.py needles (projects endpoint, ui-prefs
persistence, autoUnhide, coordinator-membership grouping). Full validate.py
ok.

Adversarial review (5 dimensions, 2-skeptic verification; several findings
reproduced by running code) confirmed 21 findings; root-cause fixes: (1) the
prefs PATCH was whole-list replacement, so a user hide racing the auto-unhide
poll, rapid double-hides, a failed boot fetch, or a second stale device could
silently wipe hides — redesigned to hide/unhide DELTAS merged server-side
(atomic in-process), plus prefs re-fetch on poll-retry and visibilitychange;
(2) prefs persist() swallowed disk errors and returned 200 — now propagates
PrefsError 500 and rolls back memory, with a new unit.prefs.test.mjs proving
durability from DISK; (3) project metrics/popovers were keyed by non-unique
project_key (two repos named "app" merge charts) — keyed by usage_key
everywhere, and the self-test now pins the 'path:<resolved>' usage_key format
(it lives in persisted prefs); (4) `project restart` ran docker restart
unguarded after stopping all servers (a missing declared container aborted
the restart half-done) — now skips missing containers and collects
action_errors like start/stop do; (5) /api/projects/action accepted arbitrary
paths — now requires the project to be coordinator-tracked or carry a real
declared runtime (synthetic missing-runtime placeholders don't count);
(6) crash-looping "Restarting" containers counted as not-running — hide
gates, auto-unhide and runningCount now use an is-active predicate and the
tree badges them "restarting"; (7) duplicate data-fk/popover keys between
tabs and the tree — usage cells are scope-prefixed; (8) reveal-toggle count
missed hidden items inside concealed projects; (9) project stop/restart
confirms now describe the coordinator's actual blast radius (declared
runtime); (10) e2e test 15's fixed random port window overlapped
coordinator-leased ranges — bind-checked ephemeral port, plus stop-idempotent
and unknown-path 404 coverage; (11) the vacuous --no-docker container-
membership assertion now asserts against the fake-docker fixture. Known
remaining gap (filed as follow-up): display membership (project_usage
identity) and runtime-action membership (build_project_runtime_spec) can
disagree for name-attributed containers — the confirm wording is honest about
it, unification needs a coordinator refactor. Post-fix: console 79/79 twice,
coordinator self-test ok, full validate.py ok.

## 2026-07-06 - Coordinator: durable per-repo port assignments (ports never drift across restarts)

Decision: The user requires ports to be fixed per repo server — agents must
always find a repo's servers on the same ports, across stops, restarts, and
time. Implemented durable port assignments in `dev_coordinator.py`: a new
top-level `state.port_assignments` map keyed `canonical_project::server_name`,
created automatically on `server start`/`server register` (and by explicit
`port assign`), surviving server stop, lease release/expiry/stale-reclaim, and
stopped-record pruning; removed only by `port unassign` (foreign pins need
`--force`). Allocation (`lease_port` and the register-adoption path) excludes
every foreign-assigned port; an explicit preferred on a foreign pin fails with
the owner named ("port N is durably assigned to server 'web' of /repo").
Owners are steered back: `server start` without `--range` pins hard to the
assigned port (a squatter is a loud error, never silent drift); with an
explicit range the pin is preferred inside it and a different landing re-pins.
`server restart` and project-runtime starts consult the assignment, so restart
works on the same port even after the stopped record was pruned. Existing
state files migrate by seeding pins from server records (running first, then
newest-stopped wins a contested port — resolves the demo-web/web-demo 3000
overlap in web-demo's favor). New surface: CLI `port assign|unassign|
assignments`, HTTP `GET /v1/ports/assignments`, `POST /v1/ports/assign|
unassign`, `port_assignments` in inventory (project-filtered, annotated with
live `server_status`, "unregistered" when only the pin remains). The
`server start --range` parser default was removed so the coordinator can tell
"no range given" (pin hard) from an explicit range. Chose a separate
assignments map over never-expiring leases because four independent reclaim
paths (TTL expiry, stale-server release, mismatched-listener release,
fixed-port reclaim) all delete leases by design. Cross-project port reuse now
requires an explicit unassign first — the self-test was updated to assert the
refusal, unassign, then proceed. Domains needed no change: console routes are
already durable per (project, serverName). Console v1.2.0 shows a "Pinned
ports" card on the Ports page (unassign with confirm, server status, pin
marker on Servers rows) via `POST /api/ports/unassign`. Coverage: self-test
blocks for pin lifecycle, prune survival, foreign refusal, unassign rules,
re-pin, register pinning, migration seeding, HTTP round-trip; console e2e 13;
six new validate.py needles. Full `validate.py`: ok.

Adversarial review (6-dimension multi-agent, 2-skeptic verification, one
finding reproduced by actually running the test) confirmed and led to fixes:
(1) `project start` resolved the fixed port as record-before-pin, silently
reverting an explicit `port assign` — precedence now declared-port > pin >
record, matching `server restart`, with a runtime fixture; (2) squatted-pin
failures through restart/project-start surfaced the opaque "no free port
available in N-N" — the loud pinned-port error now fires whenever the attempt
targeted exactly the pin; (3) owner passing `--preferred <own pin>` outside
3000-3999 without a range got a misleading range error — the pin now becomes
the range; (4) the healthy-existing short-circuit could move pins (duplicate
pins after force-assign, silent revert of an explicit re-pin) — it now only
heals a missing pin; (5) seeding could brick read_state on a malformed legacy
stopped_ts — guarded; (6) console e2e test 13 raced the console's 5s inventory
cache after direct coordinator mutations (reproduced failing) — now polls past
the window; (7) console section sigs included coordinator.lastOkAt, defeating
render memoization every 6s poll — sigs now use a stable {ok,lastError} slice;
(8) the Servers-page pin marker claimed the record port was pinned even after
a pin moved — it now compares ports and shows ":old → :new (next start)";
(9) console port-only unassign now demands `force: true` up front; (10)
self-test `free_port()` never re-issues a port any earlier fixture used,
eliminating pin-collision flakes structurally. Post-fix: self-test ok,
console 73/73, full validate.py ok.

## 2026-07-06 - DevOps Console: paged UI with hamburger nav, CPU/mem history charts, lease management

Decision: Restructured the console UI from one long page into five hash-routed
pages (`#/servers` default, `#/routes`, `#/docker`, `#/ports`,
`#/performance`) behind one sticky header (status summary + tab nav with live
counts on desktop, hamburger drawer on ≤719px). Added an in-process metrics
history store (`src/metrics.mjs`): a background sampler pulls coordinator
inventory every `METRICS_INTERVAL_MS` (default 10s) into per-entity ring
buffers (720 points) for servers (`process_usage`), running containers
(`stats`) and projects (`project_usage`); `/api/overview` fetches piggyback
into the same store. New `GET /api/metrics/history?limit=N` feeds the UI:
every running server and container row shows live CPU %/memory numbers plus a
sparkline whose click opens full CPU + memory charts; the Performance page
charts every sampled entity. Port leases became manageable from the UI via
`POST /api/ports/lease` (purpose/preferred/ttl/project, attributed
`devops-console:<email>`) and `POST /api/ports/release` (lease_id, confirmed
release). Chose in-memory history (resets on restart, UI says so) over disk
persistence — no retention policy needed, honest about scope.

Two correctness fixes surfaced by the new e2e tests: (1) the coordinator
client now invalidates its inventory/servers caches after any mutating call,
so a post-mutation overview can no longer show pre-mutation state for up to
the 5s cache window (a released lease used to linger); (2) `CoordError`s with
4xx statuses (coordinator answered, request bad — "matching lease not found")
now pass through as HTTP 400 instead of masquerading as 502 gateway failures.
Assets gained `?v=<version>` cache-busting because they are served with a 1h
immutable cache; `package.json` bumped to 1.1.0. Charts are SVG built via
`createElementNS` (the app.js innerHTML rule stays: icons map only).
validate.py gained needles for cache invalidation on mutations, the bounded
metrics ring, lease-id-required release, hamburger aria wiring, and
createElementNS charts. Tests: `unit.metrics.test.mjs` (ingest/dedupe/
trim/prune/limit/sampler) + e2e 11 (lease→overview→Origin 403→release→400 on
re-release) + e2e 12 (real coordinator server appears in metrics history with
positive RSS; limit validation; anonymous 401) — 72/72 green.

## 2026-07-06 - DevOps Console: Google OAuth live, Docker installed, per-server subdomains, HSTS

Decision: Three follow-ups after go-live. (1) Wired the real Google OAuth web
client into `.env` (gitignored) — the console left degraded mode; verified the
full authorization-code + PKCE flow reaches Google's account chooser
("continue to vr.ae", no redirect_uri_mismatch) with state/nonce/PKCE all
present. (2) Installed Docker Engine (`docker.io` 26.1.5) and enabled the
service — it was genuinely absent, which is why the console reported "Docker
unavailable"; the coordinator re-checks `docker` per inventory call so the
console now shows the Docker section as available (0 containers). (3) Added a
per-server subdomain control to the Servers block: each server row shows its
mapped `<slug>.vr.ae` (link + copy + access pill + Edit) or an "Assign
subdomain" affordance, backed by a new `POST /api/servers/subdomain
{id, slug, auth?}` endpoint that assigns/changes/removes a `kind:server` route
in one call (empty slug unassigns; a slug change creates-then-removes so a
server maps to a single subdomain). Also added an HSTS response header
(`max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`) on the TLS listener.

Why: The user reported Chrome showing "not secure" (diagnosed as stale
browser state from the earlier self-signed period — the live cert is valid
production Let's Encrypt, confirmed by an off-VM fetch and `ssl_verify=0` on
every host; HSTS added to harden and prevent http:// confusion), asked whether
Docker was installed, and asked for subdomain assignment directly from the
Servers block rather than only the Routes form.

Result: OAuth reaches Google live; Docker available; the subdomain feature is
verified live (assign default-login → change slug+public in one call → old slug
unrouted, new public route reachable anonymously → CSRF `Origin` guard 403 →
unknown-id 404) and by a new e2e test (`9b`). The endpoint reads
`serversRaw({maxAgeMs:0})` so a just-started server is never missed by the 3s
cache. Suite 63/63; `scripts/validate.py` passes; formal UI verification of the
authenticated console (with the new controls) reported no findings at 1440x900
or 390x844 (evidence: `apps/DevOpsConsole/design-qa-servers-subdomain-*.png`).
The Google client id/secret and are in the gitignored `.env`, never in the repo.

## 2026-07-05 - DevOps Console: automated wildcard renewal via 101domain API

Decision: Replaced the manual DNS-01 renewal with fully unattended automation
using the 101domain REST API (the user supplied an API key to avoid recurring
manual TXT edits). Discovered the API by probing: base
`https://api.101domain.com/v1`, `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, DNS records at
`/v1/dns/vr.ae/records` — `GET` lists, `POST {"records":[{name,type,ttl,value}]}`
creates (TTL must be ≥300; values are stored quoted but published as the bare
string, which is what ACME needs), `DELETE {"ids":[...]}` removes. Wrote certbot
`manual_auth_hook`/`manual_cleanup_hook` scripts
(`apps/DevOpsConsole/deploy/101domain/{auth,cleanup}-hook.sh`, versioned in the
repo, no secret) that create/delete the `_acme-challenge.vr.ae` TXT via the API
and poll the authoritative nameservers for propagation before returning. The
API key is stored root-only at `/etc/letsencrypt/101domain/credentials.env`
(never in the public repo; the hooks source it) and the hooks are installed to
`/etc/letsencrypt/101domain/` and wired into
`/etc/letsencrypt/renewal/vr.ae.conf`.

Why: The wildcard must renew every ≤90 days; a manual TXT step each time is a
standing outage risk (forgotten renewal → every subdomain breaks). API-driven
DNS-01 makes the certbot systemd timer renew hands-off.

Result: Verified end-to-end. `certbot renew --dry-run` succeeded unattended
("TXT propagated after 2 check(s)" for both the apex and wildcard authz), then
a real `certbot renew --force-renewal` issued a new production cert
(serial …328AC → …2A77), the cleanup hook removed the challenge records, the
deploy hook reloaded the service (SIGHUP), and the live server served the new
serial with every host still `ssl_verify=0`. The certbot timer is enabled and
will now auto-renew within 30 days of expiry. The guided manual helper
(`deploy/renew-wildcard.sh`) remains as an API-outage fallback. Security: the
API key is confined to the root-only credentials file; a repo-wide grep
confirms it appears nowhere under version control.

## 2026-07-05 - DevOps Console: *.vr.ae wildcard cert via manual DNS-01

Decision: Issued the real `*.vr.ae` + `vr.ae` Let's Encrypt wildcard so proxied
`<slug>.vr.ae` subdomains (not just the console) present a browser-trusted cert.
DNS-01 is mandatory for wildcards and `vr.ae` DNS is at 101domain with no API
credential on the box, so the challenge TXT was published by hand: certbot was
run with a blocking `--manual-auth-hook` that captures the challenge value and
holds the order open (before CA submission) until a sentinel is created, so the
operator adds `_acme-challenge.vr.ae` TXT at 101domain with zero rate-limit
risk while certbot waits. Only one fresh authorization was needed — the apex
`vr.ae` authz was still cached valid from the morning's HTTP-01 console cert.
After the record propagated to the authoritative nameservers the sentinel was
created, certbot validated and issued, and the console reloaded the cert
(same `--cert-name vr.ae` path `.env` already targets).

Why: The wildcard is the design the app was built for (arbitrary subdomains
behind one cert); HTTP-01 only covers named hosts. Manual DNS-01 was the path
the user chose (no willingness to share registrar API credentials this pass).
The blocking-hook + sentinel pattern makes a cross-turn manual DNS step
reliable without burning Let's Encrypt's 5-failed-validations-per-hour budget.

Result: `console.vr.ae`, `vr.ae`, and every `*.vr.ae` subdomain now serve the
wildcard and validate with `ssl_verify_result=0` (confirmed both on-box and
via an off-VM fetch to `https://demo.vr.ae/healthz` → trusted cert, 200).
Cert valid 89 days. Two durability fixes: (1) a **default ACL**
(`setfacl -R -d -m u:holyglory:rX /etc/letsencrypt/{live,archive}`) so each
renewal's freshly-written `privkeyN.pem` stays readable by the service user —
without it the first same-path reload failed `EACCES` on the new key; (2) the
temporary challenge-hook path certbot recorded in
`/etc/letsencrypt/renewal/vr.ae.conf` was removed so the unattended certbot
timer cleanly SKIPS this manual cert instead of invoking a vanished script.
LIMITATION: renewal is manual (~60 days) — shipped
`apps/DevOpsConsole/deploy/renew-wildcard.sh`, a guided one-command helper that
runs certbot, prints the TXT record to add, verifies propagation at the
authoritative NS, completes issuance, and reloads the service. Fully hands-off
renewal still needs a DNS API hook or acme-dns CNAME delegation (documented).

## 2026-07-05 - DevOps Console: real Let's Encrypt cert via in-app ACME HTTP-01

Decision: The console served only the self-signed fallback cert ("SSL doesn't
work" — every browser rejected it). `vr.ae` DNS is at an external registrar
(101domain) and this VM's service account has no DNS API scope, so the DNS-01
wildcard the app was designed to consume could not be provisioned here. Added
native ACME HTTP-01 support instead: the plain-HTTP :80 listener serves
`/.well-known/acme-challenge/<token>` from `ACME_WEBROOT`
(`config.acmeWebroot`, default `<stateDir>/acme`) before the https redirect
(`src/server.mjs` `tryServeAcmeChallenge`, wired ahead of the redirect and the
`/healthz` handler), with token charset validation and a resolve+prefix
traversal guard. Issued a real Let's Encrypt cert for `console.vr.ae` + `vr.ae`
via `certbot --webroot`, granted the `holyglory` service user ACL read on
`/etc/letsencrypt/{live,archive}/vr.ae`, pointed `.env` at the live PEMs, and
installed a renewal deploy hook that reloads the service (SIGHUP) on renew.

Why: A wildcard `*.vr.ae` is only issuable via DNS-01, which needs registrar
DNS access not available on this box. HTTP-01 needs only inbound port 80, which
the app already owns and which is internet-reachable (confirmed by a
Let's Encrypt staging dry-run). Serving the challenge in-app (rather than
stopping the service for `certbot --standalone`) keeps port 80 continuously
owned and makes unattended renewal work without downtime.

Result: `https://console.vr.ae` and `https://vr.ae` now present a
browser-trusted Let's Encrypt cert (verified externally via an off-VM fetch
that previously failed on the self-signed cert; `curl` reports
`ssl_verify_result=0`), valid 89 days with the certbot timer active and the
deploy hook reload proven by `certbot renew --dry-run`. The cert-path change
required a full service restart (a SIGHUP reload only re-reads the
already-configured path — documented in the README). Coverage: added an e2e
test (`1b`) asserting the challenge is served as 200 over plain HTTP for any
vhost with no redirect, plus 404 for missing tokens and traversal attempts;
suite is 62/62 and `scripts/validate.py` passes. LIMITATION: this cert covers
only the two named hosts — proxied `<slug>.vr.ae` subdomains still fail cert
validation (name mismatch) until a `*.vr.ae` wildcard is provisioned via
DNS-01 (needs 101domain DNS credentials) or on-demand per-slug HTTP-01
issuance is added. Surfaced to the user as an open decision.

## 2026-07-05 - DevOps Console web app: TLS edge + subdomain reverse proxy on vr.ae

Decision: Added `apps/DevOpsConsole/`, a zero-third-party-dependency Node 20
web app that is the public edge of the `vr.ae` VPS. It terminates TLS for
`*.vr.ae` on 443 (wildcard cert read from `.env`, hot-reloaded on file change
and SIGHUP), redirects 80→443, and Host-routes: `console.vr.ae` serves an
authenticated control panel (REST API + vanilla-JS UI), `<slug>.vr.ae`
reverse-proxies to `127.0.0.1:<port>` including WebSocket/HMR upgrades, and the
apex redirects to the console. Each subdomain route is `google` (default) or
`public`; anonymous requests to unknown slugs are made indistinguishable from
protected ones so route names cannot be enumerated. Google sign-in uses an
in-process OIDC authorization-code + PKCE flow with ID-token signature
verification against Google's JWKS (no auth library); sessions are
HMAC-SHA256-signed cookies scoped to `Domain=.vr.ae` so one login covers every
subdomain. All server/Docker/lease state and mutations go through the existing
`codex-dev-coordinator` HTTP API on loopback `127.0.0.1:29876`, which the app
autostarts if absent. Deployed via a systemd unit that grants only
`CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` (no root) and reloads the cert on SIGHUP. The app runs
in a degraded-but-real mode (public routes still proxy; auth-gated surfaces
show a setup page) until the operator creates the Google OAuth client, and
serves a self-signed `*.vr.ae` cert until the Let's Encrypt DNS-01 wildcard is
provisioned out-of-band.

Two shared coordinator changes were required and made general (the coordinator
advertises itself as pure-stdlib and Linux-ready): `listening_pid_for_port`
now resolves the owning PID via `/proc/net/tcp{,6}` + `/proc/<pid>/fd` before
falling back to `lsof`, so `server register`/adoption works on Linux hosts
without `lsof` installed (this VPS had none, which had been silently failing
the coordinator self-test and the console's own port-443 self-registration);
and `http_health` skips TLS certificate verification for loopback targets
(`127.0.0.1`/`localhost`/`::1`), because an HTTPS edge on loopback serves a
public-hostname cert that can never validate against the loopback address.

Why: The user asked for a web control center for the VPS that reuses the
coordinator as its control engine and adds in-app subdomain reverse-proxying
with Google auth on `vr.ae`. The zero-dependency Node 20 constraint keeps the
public edge auditable and free of a supply chain. Routing every control action
through the coordinator (rather than shelling out or duplicating logic) keeps
one source of truth for servers, ports, Docker, and leases shared with DevOps
Board and Codex. The coordinator portability fixes were prerequisites: without
`/proc` PID resolution the app could not register itself, and without
loopback-relaxed health checks a TLS edge could never report healthy.

Result: Live on `https://console.vr.ae` under systemd. Verified end-to-end on
the real domain: 80→443 redirect, apex/`www` redirect, 421 for foreign hosts,
anonymous console and protected/unknown slugs redirect to Google login
(indistinguishable), full route lifecycle (create defaults to login-required →
authed 200 / anon 302 → flip to public → anon 200 with no restart), CSRF
`Origin` check (mutations without a same-origin `Origin` → 403), a WebSocket
echo relayed through the 443 edge (anonymous WS upgrade to a protected slug
refused with 401 before 101), and the console self-registered with the
coordinator as a healthy server on 443. Tests: 61 node:test cases (unit + real
end-to-end against a spawned coordinator, a local OIDC issuer with real
RS256-signed tokens, and HTTP/SSE/WebSocket upstreams), all green across 10+
consecutive runs. An adversarial multi-lens security review (auth/proxy,
correctness, policy) surfaced one defense-in-depth gap — the coordinator-port
guard was enforced only on the create-route API path, not on disk-loaded or
`kind:server` routes — which was fixed in `routes.mjs`/`router.mjs` and locked
with two regression tests proven to fail pre-fix. Formal web UI verification
(mobile 390x844 + desktop 1440x900) passed with no critical or warning
findings on both the control panel and login page. `scripts/validate.py` gained
a `check_devops_console` guardrail (security-invariant text anchors,
zero-dependency enforcement, stdlib-only import scan, single-purpose innerHTML
check, `node --check` + full `node --test`) and was made resilient to hosts
without a Swift toolchain or a global git identity; the coordinator and
formal-web-ui-verification self-tests were extended to cover the new code
paths. The `formal-web-ui-verification` skill gained `--cookie` and
`--ignore-https-errors` (with must-catch self-test fixtures) so auth-gated,
self-signed-TLS pages can be verified.

## 2026-07-05 - Codex Ops Console renamed to DevOps Board; idle CPU eliminated

Decision: The macOS console app is now DevOps Board (`apps/DevOpsBoard/`,
SwiftPM package/product/executable `DevOpsBoard`), and its inventory refresh is
visibility-gated instead of free-running. The store polls only while the main
window is actually visible (tracked through `windowDidChangeOcclusionState`)
or the menu bar popover is open (tracked through the popover delegate), at a
5-second cadence; concurrent refreshes coalesce into one in-flight coordinator
run with at most one queued follow-up pass. Inventory is published only when
the decoded payload differs from the current one, project groups are computed
once per inventory change and cached on the store (`store.projectGroups`)
instead of being re-derived in every view body, per-coordinator-home inventory
commands run concurrently in a task group, and `runPython` waits via a
termination handler instead of blocking a cooperative-pool thread in
`waitUntilExit()`, with a SIGTERM/SIGKILL watchdog (60 s for inventory, 10 min
for actions, 1 h for backups) so a wedged coordinator child cannot freeze the
single-flight refresh pipeline.

Why: The app previously ran `python3 dev_coordinator.py inventory` (which
itself samples `docker stats`) every 2.5 seconds forever — including while the
window was hidden to the menu bar — so the app consumed CPU and power
continuously even when nobody was looking at it. The 2.5-second cadence also
republished identical inventory each cycle, re-rendering the whole window and
recomputing project grouping several times per pass.

Result: A hidden DevOps Board spawns no subprocesses at all; a visible one
samples half as often, skips UI work when nothing changed, and never blocks
Swift concurrency threads. `scripts/validate.py` guardrails were updated to
enforce the new contract (visibility-gated refresh, publish-on-change, cached
project groups, non-blocking process wait) and all `CodexOpsConsole` paths and
strings were renamed across the app, validation gate, CI workflow, README, and
design QA notes.

## 2026-07-03 - Functional hardening pass across all skills

Decision: A functional-only audit (security excluded per user) drove concrete
improvements. Landed: the interaction 10-label "hard reporting gate" is now
enforced by code (a shared `verify_common.interaction_checklist_missing` used by
the full-repo-audit and ui-implementation-audit verifiers) rather than SKILL.md
prose, and the ui-implementation SKILL Final Output list was reconciled from 6
labels back to the canonical 10. A new shared `full_repo_harness/merge_findings.py`
consolidates/ranks findings across hundreds of batch reports (wired into all
three audit skills' synthesis step). The coordinator gained health retry/backoff,
a `starting` vs `unhealthy` grace classification, bounded stopped-server
retention, and corrupt-state recovery (no more `SystemExit` on read). A
concurrency stress self-test now proves no double-lease. formal-web-ui added a
full-page scroll pass, `unmeasurable` contrast handling for gradient/image
backgrounds, shadow-DOM/iframe not-inspected reporting, and natural-position
occlusion. postgres-docker-backup added `verify --test-restore` (restore into a
throwaway scratch DB with guaranteed cleanup). The root-cause verifier now
recognizes `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` as a valid global policy target (dual-runtime
parity), and journey-doc discovery covers `.rst`/`.adoc` and code-comment
journeys. CI (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) now runs `scripts/validate.py`,
and validate.py gained a label-parity guard.

Why: The prior audit found the deterministic gates had honor-system joints
(the label gate was prose-only), synthesis did not scale, and several verifiers
produced false gates or crashed on edge states.

Result: `scripts/validate.py` passes end to end. Two audit claims were checked
against the code and found FALSE, so no change was made: the coordinator
port-lease is already serialized under `locked_state()` (no double-lease TOCTOU),
and source-backed audit checks already hard-fail (`source_text_errors` /
`verification_warnings` already force `ok=False`; SHA re-hash is on by default).
Excerpt-proof for non-interface files was descoped as disproportionate risk to
the 3.7k-line fixture suite; interface files already require real source quotes.

## 2026-07-02 - Dual-runtime skills and mirrored global policy (Codex + Claude Code)

Decision: Holy Skills now targets both Codex and Claude Code. Skill contracts
were made runtime-neutral (descriptions and actor wording say "agent (Codex,
Claude Code)"; `trace-fix-root-causes` names both global policy files;
`user-journey-docs-audit` maps `request_user_input` to `AskUserQuestion`).
All eight skills install into `~/.claude/skills/` in addition to
`~/.codex/skills/`, and global agent policy is maintained as a mirrored pair:
`~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (Codex) and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code). A repo
`CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md` so both runtimes read one repo policy.

Why: The same machine runs both agent runtimes against the same projects,
dev servers, Docker containers, and databases. Coordination only works if both
runtimes follow the same policies and share one coordinator state
(`~/.codex/agent-coordinator/`), and skill descriptions must trigger in both
apps.

Result: `scripts/validate.py` passes after the curation; all eight skills pass
self-tests from `~/.claude/skills/`; the installed coordinator reads the
shared machine-wide inventory. The `server_health` early-return fix for dead
PIDs (previously hand-applied only in `~/.codex/skills/`) was backported into
the repo. Known drift: `~/.codex/skills/trace-fix-root-causes/` carries a
later hand-edited revision (SKILL.md, README, openai.yaml, self_test,
verifier) that was never backported here, and `~/.codex/skills/`
`ui-implementation-audit` + `full-repo-audit` are stale deployments of commit
13b4f1e — reconcile and redeploy both directions.

## 2026-07-02 - Coordinator project resource telemetry

Decision: The Codex dev coordinator inventory emits real per-server process-tree CPU/RSS telemetry and project-level resource rollups, and CodexOpsConsole (renamed to DevOps Board on 2026-07-05) displays those rollups by repo.

Why: Managed dev servers often launch child processes that own the actual listener and resource usage. A launcher PID alone can hide runaway Next/Vite/node child processes, especially across multiple Codex/Parall coordinator homes.

Result: Inventory now includes `process_usage` per server and `project_usage` per repo. The console discovers coordinator homes, merges read-only inventory, shows project load, and flags high-load projects in the status bar.

## 2026-07-02 - Formal Web UI DOM verification

Decision: Holy Skills now includes `formal-web-ui-verification`, a Playwright-driven skill that injects deterministic JavaScript into rendered web pages to measure DOM geometry, computed styles, text fit, occlusion, media health, area-of-interest boundaries, document overflow, and visible scrollbars.

Why: UI implementation and audit workflows were still able to miss software-detectable defects such as cropped text, hidden controls, unintended overlap, off-canvas interactive elements, broken media, and invisible text. Screenshot review remains useful, but these failure classes need formal browser-side measurements that can fail delivery gates without relying on model vision.

Result: The verifier defaults to critical-only failure for low-noise delivery checks and warning-level reporting for softer risks. It supports explicit route configs, coordinator current-URL smoke checks, AOI/ignore/allow attributes, JSON/Markdown reports, and mandatory visible scrollbar inventory. Existing UI audit prompts now require the verifier whenever a safe web render path exists, and the app-wide Codex instructions require formal web UI verification after material web UI changes.

## 2026-07-03 - Formal web UI verifier recall rework

Decision: Reworked `formal-web-ui-verification` detection so it measures how real applications break, and made recall (must-catch fixtures) a permanent part of its self-test: text candidates now include any element that directly owns rendered text (div-based layouts), clipping detection covers ancestor `overflow` cuts (absolute children, negative offsets, nowrap spill) with containing-block and scroll-path awareness, occlusion reports partial coverage (≥60% critical, ≥2 points warning), broken media checks include images collapsed to ~0x0, complex-artifact exclusion is token-bounded (a `roadmap`/`sitemap` class no longer disables checks), and off-canvas rules cover left/top document-edge cuts and fixed-position viewport cuts. Intentional patterns stay non-critical: own/parent single-line ellipsis, line-clamp, carousel-context cuts, fully hidden closed-state content, skip links, app-shell inner scrollers. Coverage inventories (ellipsis truncations, hidden text-like counts, pending media, per-rule finding caps with a `findings-truncated` marker) keep gaps visible.

Why: User reported the skill "doesn't report problems now in most of the cases". Reproduction confirmed it: 10 of 11 realistic defect fixtures (div text cut by a parent card, absolutely positioned button cut by an overflow-hidden panel, negative-margin top cut, 60% badge/label overlap, collapsed broken image, invisible text in a `roadmap-section` and in a plain div, half-off-canvas button, fixed toolbar cut below the viewport, nowrap div text spilling into a clipping parent) produced zero findings, while only the synthetic self-overflow case was caught. Root cause: detection rules and self-test fixtures both mirrored the implementation (self-overflow on a fixed tag list, all-sample-points occlusion, substring artifact exclusion), so the self-test proved precision only and gave false confidence — a recall gap, not a regression from one bad edit.

Result: All 11 realistic defect fixtures now produce criticals; the prior contract fixtures still pass; the extended self-test fails against the pre-fix verifier at the first new fixture (fail-before/pass-after proven). Noise checks stay clean: a composite modern page (sticky header, ellipsis card titles inside overflow-hidden cards, line-clamp, scrollable table, FAB, sr-only link) yields zero findings at mobile and desktop — this page also caught and now guards a false positive where an element's own ellipsis was re-tested against its parent's clip — and real pages (example.com, news.ycombinator.com) yield zero criticals with plausible warnings only. `scripts/validate.py` passes. Guardrails updated: repo `AGENTS.md` skill-development recall rule, and the generalized detector-recall rule in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, and the curated mirror `reference/codex-app-wide/AGENTS.md`.
