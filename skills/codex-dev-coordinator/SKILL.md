# Codex Dev Coordinator

Use this skill before starting local dev servers, allocating ports, inspecting
running services, or managing Docker when multiple agent sessions or app
instances (Codex, Claude Code, or both) may be working on the same machine.

## Core Rule

Do not start dev/test servers, Docker Compose services, Docker containers, or
local database stacks directly with default ports. First run `inventory` to see
what is already running. When the user asks to run, start, restart, check, or
open a project's dev server, prefer the project-level runtime command:

```bash
PROJECT_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py project start --agent "$USER" --project "$PROJECT_ROOT"
```

Use individual `server` and `docker` commands only for narrow operations on a
specific service after the project runtime status has made the dependency
picture clear.

Never do the pattern "try the default port, then try another one if busy." The
coordinator is the source of truth.

Every mutating coordinator command must identify the agent and canonical repo
path. Use `PROJECT_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"`
before starting, stopping, restarting, registering, or changing dev servers,
Docker containers, Docker Compose services, local databases, port leases, or
destructive coordinator state. Port release is restricted to the lease-owning
project, and destructive state reset retains attributed prior-state evidence.

## Shared State

The bundled script stores leases and server metadata under:

```bash
~/.codex/agent-coordinator/
```

The default is relative to the current process's resolved home. It is shared
only by runtimes executing as the same OS user with the same home. A sandboxed
desktop runtime, VM, or different account can resolve another directory. Run
`inventory` in each runtime and compare its `coordinator_home` field before
assuming that leases and operations are mutually visible.

For multiple runtimes owned by one OS user, set the same absolute private path
in every runtime when shared coordination is required:

```bash
export CODEX_AGENT_COORDINATOR_HOME=/path/to/shared/codex-agent-coordinator
```

Do not use one coordinator home across different OS users or VM security
boundaries. The directory is deliberately `0700` and the coordinator has no
multi-user ACL, authentication, or ownership protocol. Keep separate homes and
aggregate their read-only inventories through an explicitly source-aware tool
when cross-boundary visibility is needed.

The script uses a lock file in that directory so concurrent agents cannot lease
the same port. The lock protects short state snapshot, reservation, and commit
phases; it is not held while starting or stopping processes, polling health,
running Docker, inspecting listeners, scanning inventory/backups, or writing an
HTTP response. Same-target lifecycle mutations are rejected while an operation
is pending, while unrelated projects and leases continue independently. A
pending project lifecycle also excludes direct server and Docker mutations for
that canonical project. Only synchronous child work carrying the exact internal
parent-operation capability may run inside it; callers cannot supply that
capability through CLI or HTTP payloads.

The coordinator home is mode `0700`; state, lock, API-token, and log files are
private. State writes use an exclusive temporary file, `fsync`, and atomic
replacement. State schema v2 includes a monotonic revision and a bounded
operation journal. Abandoned pre-launch reservations release their leases; a
still-live process whose operation owner disappeared is retained as `orphaned`
evidence rather than having its lease silently reassigned. Pending operations
record a locked process-instance identity, so age alone never retires a verified
live owner and a reused PID cannot impersonate the process that made the
reservation.

## Quick Start

Resolve the script path relative to this skill directory:

```bash
PROJECT_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py inventory --project "$PROJECT_ROOT"
```

```bash
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py port lease --agent "$USER" --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" --range 3000-3999
```

Start or verify a whole project runtime first. This uses the canonical project
path as the stable runtime identity, starts declared dependencies before web
processes, preserves fixed ports, and returns URLs, ports, service status,
dependency classifications, recent logs, and previous exit reasons:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py project status --project "$PROJECT_ROOT"
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py project start --agent "$USER" --project "$PROJECT_ROOT"
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py project restart --agent "$USER" --project "$PROJECT_ROOT"
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py project stop --agent "$USER" --project "$PROJECT_ROOT"
```

For a single managed process inside a project, start a server and let the
coordinator lease the port, keep the PID, store logs, and health-check it:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py server start \
  --agent "$USER" \
  --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" \
  --name web \
  --cwd "$PROJECT_ROOT" \
  --cmd 'npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port {port}' \
  --range 3000-3999 \
  --health-url 'http://127.0.0.1:{port}/'
```

### Durable port assignments (ports are fixed per repo server)

The first successful `server start` or `server register` for a
`(canonical project, server name)` identity durably pins that port to the
server. The pin lives in `state.json` under `port_assignments`, survives
server stops, lease expiry, and stopped-record pruning, and is removed only by
an explicit unassign (or `state reset`). Consequences agents can rely on:

- Restarting a server — even weeks later, after its stopped record was pruned —
  lands on the same port, so tests and tooling can hard-code where a repo's
  servers live. Look the port up while the server is stopped:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py port assignments --project "$PROJECT_ROOT"
```

- No other project can lease, start on, or register over a pinned port. Such
  attempts fail with an error naming the owner
  (`port N is durably assigned to server 'web' of /repo`); do not work around
  it — pick another port or ask the owner to unassign.
- Starting the owner without `--range` treats the pinned port as the only
  acceptable outcome: if a foreign process squats it, the start fails loudly
  instead of silently drifting to a new port.
- Passing an explicit `--preferred`/`--range` that lands the owner on a
  different port re-pins the assignment to the new port.
- Pin a port ahead of the first start, or release one:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py port assign --agent "$USER" --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" --name web --port 3210
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py port unassign --agent "$USER" --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" --name web
```

`port unassign --port N --force` removes another project's pin (for example an
orphan left by a moved or renamed repo); without `--force` foreign pins are
protected. Pre-assignment state files are migrated automatically: every
existing server record seeds a pin for its recorded port, and when two records
contest one port the most recently stopped record wins.

`--cmd` is compatibility input. It is parsed into argv and is never evaluated
by a shell; shell control operators such as `;`, `&&`, pipes, redirects, and
newlines are rejected. Prefer structured argv when quoting would be ambiguous:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py server start \
  --agent "$USER" \
  --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" \
  --name web \
  --cwd "$PROJECT_ROOT" \
  --argv '["npm","run","dev","--","--host","127.0.0.1","--port","{port}"]' \
  --range 3000-3999
```

When a preceding workflow already owns an active lease whose purpose is
`manual`, attach that exact lease instead of releasing it and racing to lease
the port again. Exact-lease start accepts structured argv only:

```bash
LEASE_ID="$({
  python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py port lease \
    --agent "$USER" \
    --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" \
    --range 3000-3999 \
    --purpose manual
} | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["id"])')"

python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py server start \
  --agent "$USER" \
  --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" \
  --name web \
  --cwd "$PROJECT_ROOT" \
  --argv '["npm","run","dev","--","--host","127.0.0.1","--port","{port}"]' \
  --lease-id "$LEASE_ID" \
  --health-url 'http://127.0.0.1:{port}/'
```

The lease must still be active and unexpired, have purpose `manual`, be
unbound, and belong to the same agent and canonical project. The start reserves
the server lifecycle and exact lease in one outer operation, uses its exact ID
and port, and never allocates a replacement lease. Port release and direct
project/server lifecycle mutations that conflict with that attachment are
rejected until it completes. A failure before process launch restores the
manual lease as unbound. Once process launch has occurred, a failed health
check or uncertain outcome keeps the lease attached as explicit failure or
reconciliation evidence until an attributed stop or release clears it; it is
never silently returned to the manual pool.

Project runtime declarations may likewise provide `"argv": [...]` instead of
`"cmd"`. The persisted `LaunchSpec` contains argv, cwd, declared environment,
agent, project, and source provenance, so restart retains the explicitly
declared environment.

If a server is already running on the declared fixed port but is not registered,
adopt it instead of starting a duplicate. Adoption is allowed only when the
listener PID can be attributed to the canonical project root. If the occupied
port belongs to another repo, fix the stale coordinator metadata or register
the real owner instead of attaching that listener to the current project:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py server register \
  --agent "$USER" \
  --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" \
  --name web \
  --port 3000 \
  --url 'http://127.0.0.1:3000'
```

Check, restart, and stop:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py server status --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" --name web
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py server restart --agent "$USER" --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" --name web
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py server stop --agent "$USER" --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" --name web
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py server logs --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" --name web --tail 200
```

Direct server restart holds one outer reservation across its delegated stop and
start children, so another stop/start/restart cannot interleave in the gap.

The coordinator keeps managed server log paths and stopped server records. When
a managed server stops or its PID exits, inventory exposes `stopped_at`,
`stopped_reason`, and `log_path`, and `server logs` returns the requested log
tail plus the stop metadata.

Inventory also exposes real per-server process CPU/RSS and project-level
resource rollups. For managed dev servers, the coordinator samples the launcher
PID plus its child process tree so Node/Next/Vite child processes are counted
under the correct canonical repo. Use `inventory --project "$PROJECT_ROOT"` or
project `status` evidence before assuming a server is healthy when it is slow,
GC-bound, or memory-heavy. The `project_usage` rollup lists CPU percent, memory
bytes, process counts, and hot PIDs by repo; it must be treated as diagnostic
evidence, not synthetic UI decoration. Each row also carries authoritative
membership (`usage_key`, `server_ids`, `container_names`) so UIs group
inventory rows without re-implementing repo-identity heuristics.

Display grouping and whole-project actions share one membership model: the
same attribution that places a container in a `project_usage` row decides
whether `project start|restart|stop` acts on it. Explicit attribution (Docker
Compose labels, then coordinator sidecar metadata) always wins; an
unattributed container is claimed by a known repo only when exactly one known
project path matches its name key; a container whose name key matches several
known repos stays in its own name-keyed group (`usage_key` `name:<key>`,
`project` null) and no whole-project action touches it. A UI grouped by
`project_usage` therefore shows exactly the blast radius of whole-project
actions.

Inventory must show one current row per logical server identity
(`canonical project path + server name`). Repeated starts, stops, restarts, or
adoptions of the same fixed-port service must not appear as multiple runnable
rows with the same URL or port. If stale state records exist from older runs,
inventory collapses them into the preferred current record and may expose
`duplicate_count` / `duplicate_server_ids` as diagnostic metadata.
Stopped or stale records whose ports are now reused by another project must not
be exposed as current URLs. Inventory marks those rows with
`url_is_current=false`, `port_reused=true`, and `port_reused_by` evidence so
agents and UI surfaces do not open the wrong app.

## HTTP Endpoint Mode

Run a single coordinator endpoint when agents prefer tool-style JSON calls:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py api serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 29876
```

The API is a local capability endpoint, not a remote administration service.
It supports `localhost` or IPv4 loopback binds such as `127.0.0.1`; wildcard,
non-loopback, and IPv6 binds are rejected before the server is created. At first start it creates
`~/.codex/agent-coordinator/api-token` with mode `0600` (override with
`CODEX_AGENT_COORDINATOR_TOKEN_FILE` or `--token-file`). Only `GET /healthz` is
anonymous. Every `/v1/*` request must send:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <contents of api-token>
```

The server validates loopback `Host`, same-origin browser requests, JSON
content type, and a 64 KiB body limit, and bounds concurrent request workers.
Do not print, commit, or put the token in a URL. A group/world-readable or
symlinked token file is rejected. Concurrent first starts converge on one
exclusively created token; every process reopens the winning credential rather
than replacing it with a different token.

Useful endpoints:

- `GET /v1/inventory`
- `GET /v1/state`
- `GET /v1/ports`
- `GET /v1/ports/assignments`
- `GET /v1/servers`
- `POST /v1/ports/lease`
- `POST /v1/ports/release`
- `POST /v1/ports/assign`
- `POST /v1/ports/unassign`
- `POST /v1/servers/start`
- `POST /v1/servers/register`
- `POST /v1/servers/stop`
- `POST /v1/servers/restart`
- `POST /v1/servers/status`
- `POST /v1/servers/logs`
- `POST /v1/projects/status`
- `POST /v1/projects/start`
- `POST /v1/projects/restart`
- `POST /v1/projects/stop`
- `POST /v1/docker/ps`
- `POST /v1/docker/stats`
- `POST /v1/docker/compose-up`
- `POST /v1/docker/compose-down`
- `POST /v1/docker/logs`
- `POST /v1/docker/register`
- `POST /v1/docker/start`
- `POST /v1/docker/stop`
- `POST /v1/docker/restart`

POST bodies are JSON and use the same option names as the CLI without leading
dashes. Prefer the `argv` array over a legacy `cmd` string, for example:

```json
{"agent":"codex-a","project":"/repo","name":"web","cwd":"/repo","argv":["npm","run","dev","--","--port","{port}"],"range":"3000-3999"}
```

To consume an existing manual lease through the API, include its exact
`"lease_id"` in the same `/v1/servers/start` payload. The same ownership,
expiry, source, binding, structured-argv, and rollback rules apply.

## Docker

Use Docker commands through the coordinator so agents have one visible control
surface:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py docker ps
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py docker stats
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py docker ps --all
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py docker compose-up --agent "$USER" --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" --cwd "$PROJECT_ROOT" --file docker-compose.yml --detach
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py docker compose-down --agent "$USER" --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" --cwd "$PROJECT_ROOT" --file docker-compose.yml
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py docker logs --container my-container --tail 80
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py docker register --agent "$USER" --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" --container my-container --role web
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py docker start --agent "$USER" --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" --container my-container
python3 scripts/dev_coordinator.py docker restart --agent "$USER" --project "$PROJECT_ROOT" --container my-container
```

Use `--dry-run` when Docker may not be installed or when validating the command
shape without changing containers.

Docker execution does not assume an interactive-shell `PATH`. The coordinator
resolves `CODEX_DOCKER_CLI` when it names an absolute executable, then the
current `PATH`, then standard Homebrew, Docker Desktop, OrbStack, and per-user
installation locations. It preserves the discovered `docker` entry-point path
instead of canonicalizing a multicall symlink to a differently named target.
Real Docker calls are bounded by observation and lifecycle timeouts; dry-run
never requires a Docker installation.

Project start, restart, and stop preflight Docker before mutating any managed
process whenever the declaration includes Compose or an attributed container.
The bounded preflight verifies the Docker executable, daemon, and—when
declared—the Compose plugin. An unavailable capability returns a complete project report with
`ok=false`, `classification=missing_dependency`, `actions=[]`,
`partial=false`, and structured `action_errors[].capability` evidence instead
of partially changing the runtime or exposing a raw `FileNotFoundError`.
Failures after one or more successful actions return the same report shape with
`partial=true`, the completed `actions`, and structured `action_errors`.

Existing Docker labels cannot be rewritten for running containers. When Docker
does not provide Compose project labels, register coordinator-side metadata with
`docker register` or let `docker start/stop/restart` attach it automatically
from `--agent` and `--project`. Inventory merges real Docker Compose labels
first, then coordinator sidecar metadata for unlabeled containers.

When a declared dependency is also owned by declared Compose, keep the
dependency for health/readiness evidence and map its lifecycle explicitly with
`"service": "<compose-service>"` (preferred), or give it a `name` that exactly
matches an entry in `docker.services`. Compose then exclusively owns its
start/stop/restart lifecycle, while unrelated declared containers retain direct
container lifecycle management. Project restart safely uses `compose restart`
for observed running services and `compose up -d` for missing or stopped
services; recovery actions run before dependent restarts, and the coordinator
does not force-recreate containers or risk writable-layer data.

A container name or image that resembles a repository name is discovery
evidence only. Project start, restart, and stop may mutate a container only when
it is explicitly declared in the runtime, has a Compose working-directory label
for the canonical project, or has prior coordinator-side registration with
matching project and agent metadata. Name-only matches remain visible as
`read_only_evidence=true` and `mutation_authorized=false`; they must never be
auto-registered or passed to a Docker lifecycle command.

Docker lifecycle reservations normalize container names and short IDs through
`docker inspect` to the immutable full container ID before reserving state. Two
aliases for the same container therefore conflict as one mutation target. If
that immutable identity cannot be verified, lifecycle mutation and sidecar
registration fail closed.

When a project runtime declaration names an existing unlabeled container,
`project start` adopts that container into coordinator-side metadata before it
reports final status, and `project stop`/`project restart` record the same
sidecar attribution for the containers they act on. This keeps databases such
as `aerodb-pg` grouped under the repo that declared them instead of under a
name-derived pseudo-project.

The shared inventory includes stopped containers (`docker ps --all`) so agents
can see containers that are available to start instead of accidentally creating
duplicates.

Inventory also includes real telemetry for running containers when Docker is
available. The coordinator samples `docker stats --no-stream`, stores a bounded
rolling `stats_history` per container, and exposes current CPU, memory, network
I/O, and block I/O values plus per-second network/block rates. Stopped
containers remain visible but do not receive live stats.

## Project Runtime Declarations

Project runtime declarations live at `.codex/dev-runtime.json` by default. Use
them when a repo needs a database, worker, Docker Compose service, fixed port,
or meaningful readiness check. A project-level `start` must not report success
only because the web process answers `/`; required dependencies and declared
readiness checks must also pass.
Default HTTP health accepts 2xx and 3xx responses. A 4xx response, including a
foreign app's 404 on the requested health path, is unhealthy unless the repo
declares a more specific readiness check that proves the app is actually ready.

Docker Compose mutation requires an explicit runtime declaration. If a repo has
`docker-compose.yml` but no `.codex/dev-runtime.json`, the coordinator may show
the file as discovered evidence, but `project start` must not run `docker
compose up` from that discovery. Add a declaration or register/adopt the
already-running containers instead of creating a duplicate stack.

Minimal example:

```json
{
  "name": "example-app",
  "docker": {
    "compose_files": ["docker-compose.yml"],
    "services": ["postgres", "worker"]
  },
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "web",
      "role": "web",
      "port": 3000,
      "cmd": "npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port {port}",
      "health_url": "http://127.0.0.1:{port}/"
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "type": "docker",
      "name": "postgres",
      "container": "example-postgres",
      "ports": [{"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 5432}]
    }
  ],
  "health_checks": [
    {
      "name": "app-ready",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/health",
      "expect_status": 200,
      "expect_text": "ok"
    }
  ]
}
```

If there is no declaration, the coordinator may discover existing managed
servers, Docker Compose files, Compose working-directory labels, and matching
containers. Container discovery uses the same attribution as inventory's
`project_usage` grouping: a container explicitly attributed to another project
never joins this project's runtime, and a name match claims a container only
when this project is the single known claimant for its name key. If the
coordinator still cannot identify a complete runtime, it returns `ok=false`
with `classification=missing_dependency` instead of guessing ports or
reporting success.

## Agent Workflow

1. Set `PROJECT_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"`, then
   run `inventory --project "$PROJECT_ROOT"` before starting, stopping, or replacing any
   local service.
2. For "run/start/restart/check the dev server", call `project status` or
   `project start` with the canonical repo path. Do not manually run package
   manager dev commands, Docker, database, worker, and web commands unless the
   project runtime report points to a specific service-level repair.
3. Treat `ok=false` as not ready even when a web URL exists. Report the
   coordinator's classification: `wrong_port`, `stopped_container`,
   `crashed_process`, `unhealthy_process`, `timeout`, `missing_dependency`, or
   `stale_coordinator_metadata`.
4. Keep project ports fixed. Add or update `.codex/dev-runtime.json` when a
   repo needs a fixed web, database, or worker port. Use `--allow-port-change`
   only when the user explicitly asks to change ports.
   `project start` may reclaim same-project fixed-port leases that were left by
   stopped, missing, or dead managed servers; do not manually switch to a new
   port to work around stale coordinator metadata.
   Durable port assignments back this policy automatically: every managed or
   registered server keeps its port across stops, restarts, and record pruning,
   and `port assignments --project "$PROJECT_ROOT"` answers "where does this
   repo's server live" even while it is stopped. If a start fails because the
   pinned port is unavailable, surface the error instead of moving the server.
5. When a dependency is stopped or unhealthy, preserve the evidence in the
   runtime report (`before`, recent logs, previous exit reasons), then recover
   through `project start` or `project restart`, and report both evidence and
   final status.
6. Use individual `server`, `docker`, and `port` commands for explicit
   service-level tasks only after the project runtime is understood.
7. If an already-running server or unlabeled Docker container belongs to the
   repo, register it. `project start` adopts healthy fixed-port servers
   automatically; use `server register` or `docker register` for explicit
   repairs.
8. Before trusting or stopping an adopted process, verify listener ownership
   through the process cwd/git root. If a registered server PID or port belongs
   to another project, treat it as `stale_coordinator_metadata`; do not report
   it as working and do not kill the foreign PID.

## Health, Status, And State Robustness

- `server status` re-checks health a few times with a short backoff before
  concluding a server is down, so a transient blip or a still-warming server is
  not misclassified after a single miss.
- A live, correctly-owned server that fails its health check within its startup
  grace window is reported as `starting`, not `unhealthy`, so a slow boot does
  not trigger needless restart churn. After the grace window it becomes
  `unhealthy`. `server_health` also returns a `classification` of `healthy`,
  `starting`, `unhealthy`, `wrong-listener`, or `stopped`.
- Stopped-server records are retained for evidence but pruned once they pass the
  retention window or exceed the per-home cap, so the shared state file does not
  grow without bound across months of start/stop cycles.
- Pruning never touches durable port assignments: a server whose stopped record
  aged out still owns its pinned port and restarts on it.
- A corrupt state file (for example a partial write after a crash) is backed up
  to `state.json.corrupt-<epoch>` and replaced with a fresh default state, so
  read-only commands like `inventory` recover instead of failing. Because a
  corrupt file cannot supply trustworthy records, recovery clears durable port
  assignments; each server pins its port again on its next successful start or
  registration.
- Managed server and project start, stop, and restart plus direct Docker
  lifecycle calls reserve and commit state in short locked phases. Process
  spawn, health polling, termination, Docker execution/inspection, project
  discovery, inventory collection, server registration, and Docker statistics
  happen outside the cross-agent lock, so an unrelated lease is not blocked by
  a slow service operation. Project mutations retain bounded operation-journal
  evidence with the committed result summary.
- Read-only health/inventory routes use a consistent state snapshot and commit
  observations optimistically. Each observation reserves a monotonic per-server
  ticket; only the newest ticket with the same lifecycle fingerprint may
  commit. A slow older check or a health result measured before a stop/restart
  can be returned for its own request, but cannot overwrite the newer server
  record. Docker statistics histories merge by sample identity instead of
  replacing concurrent samples.
- Repository roots, branches, and short commits are read from local `.git`
  metadata; state-critical paths do not invoke the Git executable or a Git
  credential/network helper while holding the coordinator lock.
- Failed process launches release their reserved leases and retain failed
  operation evidence for coordinator-allocated leases. Exact manual-lease
  starts instead restore the unbound manual lease only when no process was
  launched; after launch they quarantine the lease with explicit failure
  evidence until attributed cleanup. Generation checks keep a superseded
  operation from overwriting a newer server record.

## Safety Notes

- The coordinator does not grant permissions. It runs structured argv as the
  current OS user and invokes the local Docker CLI without a command shell.
- Use project-specific `--name` values. Avoid generic names like `server` when a
  repo has multiple services.
- Set `--ttl` for short-lived port leases that are not attached to a managed
  server. Expired leases are ignored during new allocation.
- Leases and assignments are different things: a lease says "this port is in
  use right now" and expires or is released on stop; a durable assignment says
  "this port belongs to this repo's server" and never expires. Manual
  `port lease` calls do not create assignments.
- Use `--json` on CLI commands when another script or agent will parse output.
