# Formal Web UI Verification

This skill runs a deterministic Playwright/Chromium heuristic over rendered
web pages. It measures DOM geometry, computed visibility, clipping, occlusion,
off-canvas controls, broken media, contrast risks, document overflow, and
visible scrollbars with their same-axis nesting chains. Every horizontal
scrollbar is a warning; nested horizontal scrolling is blocking. Two vertical
scroll layers warn and three or more block, with the document scrollbar
counting as a layer and mixed axes kept separate. It also measures rendered
placeholders and selected option labels without retaining their text, supports
opt-in readable-content inset
contracts, and samples immediately around declared responsive breakpoints.
It traverses discoverable open shadow roots, evaluates
Playwright-reachable frames, supports mobile device descriptors, and can open
declared interaction states with bounded actions. It complements screenshots
and human review; it cannot discover closed shadow roots or prove undeclared UI
states correct, and it reports reachable contexts it cannot evaluate as
coverage limits.

Every effective target/state also declares its primary journey, frequency/risk
context, semantic rendered regions, light/dark/mixed theme, and
repository-relative UI review inputs. The verifier rejects secondary workflows
above primary content, offscreen or unfocused continuation, nested horizontal
scrolling, triple vertical scroll nesting, WCAG text contrast failures, and
large declared-theme contradictions. Palette-cohesion risks stay
explicit agent-review evidence rather than automatic aesthetic verdicts.

Each checked cell automatically captures a redacted initial viewport and full
page. `review-queue.json` contains only cells whose mapped UI inputs or
journey/theme intent changed, or whose route/state/viewport is new. Screenshot
hashes prove artifact integrity and never trigger review.

Run the self-test before relying on it:

```bash
python3 skills/formal-web-ui-verification/scripts/self_test.py
```

The self-test resolves Playwright explicitly from the repository's locked
`ci/playwright/node_modules` installation (or
`FORMAL_WEB_UI_PLAYWRIGHT_NODE_MODULES`) and passes that path to the verifier.
It does not depend on the temporary audit directory or a manually injected
`NODE_PATH`. If the locked dependency has not been installed in a checkout,
run `npm ci --ignore-scripts --prefix ci/playwright` once.

Verify explicit targets through a complete config. Bare `--url` targets fail
coverage because they have no journey/theme/input contract:

```bash
node skills/formal-web-ui-verification/scripts/formal_web_ui_verify.mjs \
  --config formal-web-ui.json \
  --fail-on critical
```

See `references/journey_review_contract.md` for the complete target/state
schema and changed-review workflow.

Target-specific breakpoint samples, readable insets, and deployment/source
binding are configured together:

```json
{
  "repoRoot": "/absolute/path/to/repository",
  "targetDefaults": {
    "journeys": [{"id": "view-items", "frequencyPercent": 100, "risk": "normal"}],
    "primaryJourney": "view-items",
    "regions": [{"selector": ".items-card", "role": "primary-content", "journey": "view-items"}],
    "theme": "light",
    "reviewInputs": [{"path": "src/items", "kind": "ui-code"}]
  },
  "targets": [{
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/items",
    "breakpointProfile": {
      "name": "items-layout",
      "breakpoints": [768, 1024],
      "height": 900
    },
    "contentInsets": [{"selector": ".items-card", "min": 12}],
    "sourceBinding": {"expected": "git:abc123"}
  }],
  "viewports": [{"name": "desktop", "width": 1440, "height": 900}],
  "maxPageCount": 12
}
```

Each breakpoint adds `breakpoint−1`, `breakpoint`, and `breakpoint+1` for only
that target. Equivalent cells are de-duplicated. Expansion above
`maxPageCount` fails setup instead of silently sampling fewer pages. A source
binding reads `X-UI-Source-Revision` (or a configured meta name/header) from
the deployment and fails coverage when it is missing or differs from the
expected source value.

The default invocation creates a unique external artifact directory (normally
under the system temporary root), writes complete `report.json` and `report.md`
files, `review-queue.json`, and screenshot pairs, then prints one bounded JSON
receipt with the exit code, coverage, counts, directory, and filenames. Use
`--json-out` and `--markdown-out` to select known artifact paths; supplying one
derives the other. Setup/configuration failures use the same bounded receipt and
machine-readable artifact contract when a safe destination is available.
Reports record run and per-cell start/end times, verifier and privacy-safe
effective-config SHA-256 hashes, requested and final paths, every exact
route/state/viewport cell, sampled-only width coverage, and per-cell
deployment/source binding status. A sign-in redirect or stale bound deployment
does not count as checked coverage.

Full Markdown stdout is available only through the explicit human-terminal
compatibility flag `--human-readable-stdout`. Do not use that flag for agent
runs.

The formerly published `--receipt-only` flag and boolean config `receiptOnly`
remain accepted as deprecated no-op compatibility inputs. Neither changes the
safe default, and `receiptOnly: false` cannot enable full stdout.

Exit codes:

- `0`: required pages were checked and no configured finding threshold failed.
- `1`: blocking UI findings were detected.
- `2`: configuration, browser, or dependency setup failed.
- `3`: a required target could not be checked, redirected to another route,
  failed its source binding, or the minimum checked-page count was not met.

After all automatic checks complete, open only the queue's screenshot pairs and
finalize decisions with `scripts/formal_web_ui_review.py`. A verifier exit `0`
with pending changed review is not visual completion; unchanged prior gaps stay
blocking without reopening the same images.

Explicit target failures are fail-closed. Coordinator-discovered failures can
be tolerated only with the explicit `--allow-discovered-target-failures` flag,
and remain visible in the report.

`--from-coordinator` is optional and requires the caller to pass
`--coordinator-script` pointing at a separately installed coordinator. This
skill does not import, clone, pin, build, or test that external source.
