# Journey, Theme, And Changed-Review Contract

Use this reference when preparing a formal Web UI verifier configuration or
finalizing its visual review. Every target—including login, utility, and
component-demo targets—needs a complete contract. A bare `--url` intentionally
fails target coverage.

## Complete Target Example

```json
{
  "repoRoot": "/absolute/path/to/repository",
  "targets": [{
    "name": "accounts",
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/accounts",
    "journeys": [
      {
        "id": "view-accounts",
        "name": "View and manage accounts",
        "frequencyPercent": 99,
        "risk": "normal",
        "rationale": "Normal destination use"
      },
      {
        "id": "add-account",
        "name": "Add an account",
        "frequencyPercent": 1,
        "risk": "normal",
        "rationale": "Occasional creation"
      }
    ],
    "primaryJourney": "view-accounts",
    "regions": [
      {
        "name": "Account collection",
        "selector": "[data-ui-region='accounts']",
        "role": "primary-content",
        "journey": "view-accounts"
      },
      {
        "name": "Compact account tools",
        "selector": "[data-ui-region='account-tools']",
        "role": "supporting"
      }
    ],
    "theme": "light",
    "reviewInputs": [
      {"path": "src/accounts", "kind": "ui-code"},
      {"path": "src/styles/accounts.css", "kind": "style"},
      {"path": "src/design/tokens.css", "kind": "tokens"},
      {"path": "public/account-icons", "kind": "asset"}
    ],
    "states": [{
      "name": "add-account-open",
      "actions": [{"action": "click", "selector": "[data-action='add-account']"}],
      "primaryJourney": "add-account",
      "priorityOverrideReason": "The user explicitly activated account creation",
      "regions": [{
        "name": "Add account dialog",
        "selector": "[role='dialog'][data-purpose='add-account']",
        "role": "primary-content",
        "journey": "add-account"
      }],
      "continuation": {
        "kind": "in-page",
        "anchor": "[role='dialog'][data-purpose='add-account'] h2",
        "focusWithin": "[role='dialog'][data-purpose='add-account']",
        "maxScrollDelta": 8
      }
    }]
  }],
  "viewports": [
    {"name": "mobile", "width": 390, "height": 844},
    {"name": "desktop", "width": 1440, "height": 900}
  ]
}
```

`targetDefaults` may provide the same fields for coordinator-discovered or
repeated fixture targets, but every effective target/state still must resolve a
complete contract.

## Journey And Region Rules

- Journey IDs are stable. Each definition includes `frequencyPercent` and
  `risk` (`critical`, `high`, `normal`, or `low`).
- Exactly one `primaryJourney` owns each target/state. If it is not the
  highest-frequency journey, provide `priorityOverrideReason`; rare urgent work
  can legitimately be primary, but the decision must be explicit.
- `primary-content` is the named destination object or current task.
- `workflow-surface` is another journey such as create, edit, configuration,
  or administration. A lower-priority workflow before primary content fails.
- `supporting` is a compact title, search, filter, sort, or toolbar. When it
  consumes more than a compact share before primary content, it fails.
- `blocking-alert` may precede primary content only with a non-empty reason.
- Product/journey documentation defines these semantic roles. The verifier
  configuration maps them to exact selectors; do not put CSS selectors into
  product intent merely to satisfy the tool.

## Continuation Rules

Every state containing an activating click, press, check, uncheck, or selection
declares `continuation`.

- `in-page`: the anchor must be visible in the user's current viewport, focus
  must be inside `focusWithin`, and document movement must stay within
  `maxScrollDelta` (8 CSS pixels by default). A modal, mobile sheet, or nearby
  expansion can pass; a form appended below a long collection fails.
- The anchor is the revealed heading or first field. A custom component may
  mark an equivalent recognizable element with `data-ui-continuation-anchor`;
  using a broad container merely because it intersects the viewport fails.
- `navigation`: set `expectedPath`. The destination must stay on the expected
  origin and render the declared anchor in its initial viewport. Focus is not
  required merely because a new document loaded.
- `triggerActionIndex` identifies the action immediately before which the
  verifier records the user's current scroll position. It defaults to the last
  action.

## Conditional Control Ownership

A conditional action may declare both `ownerJourney` and `ownerState`:

```json
{
  "action": "click",
  "selector": "[data-action='advanced-target']",
  "ownerJourney": "advanced-targeting",
  "ownerState": "advanced-targeting-open"
}
```

The named owner must resolve to exactly one configured state in the same target
group, and that state's primary journey must match. Outside its owner, an absent
or hidden control records an immediate zero-wait handoff. If it is visible
outside the owner, the ownership contract is contradictory and fails. In the
owner state, the normal action and continuation contracts apply. Do not label a
control as conditionally owned merely to avoid a legitimate readiness wait.

## Observable Readiness

`waitFor` may combine these exact signals:

- `selector`, optionally raced against `errorSelector`;
- `responseUrl` or `url` (armed before the triggering action);
- `loadState` or an explicit `networkIdleMs` deadline;
- `readback: {url, status, jsonPath?, equals?, intervalMs?}`;
- `renderFrames: 1|2`;
- compatibility `settleMs` only from 0 through 100 ms.

`timeoutMs`, `loadStateTimeoutMs`, and `networkIdleMs` are event failure
ceilings and may exceed 100 ms. `settleMs`, `pollIntervalMs`, and readback
`intervalMs` are deliberate intervals and may never exceed 100 ms. An empty
wait contract advances after two animation frames rather than an arbitrary
sleep. `afterFailureWaitFor` may collect one bounded downstream observation
after an ordinary interaction failure.

## Safe Complete Execution

Top-level `execution.maxConcurrency` is 4 by default. Each target/state may
declare:

```json
{
  "execution": {
    "parallelSafe": true,
    "resourceLocks": ["fixture-account-42"],
    "priority": 50000,
    "stopOnFailure": true,
    "stopReason": "A failed mutation can invalidate shared fixture state"
  }
}
```

Undeclared work is exclusive. Parallel-safe cells may overlap only when their
resource locks do not conflict. A fresh browser context isolates each cell, but
does not prove that shared server data is isolated. Results retain declared
plan order plus separate execution indices. Explicit priority overrides the
default risk-plus-frequency score and changes start order only.

Use `stopOnFailure` only when a failure can corrupt shared state or invalidate
later evidence, and always provide `stopReason`. It is not a fail-fast shortcut:
undeclared ordinary failures continue. A declared unsafe failure names every
remaining unexecuted cell.

Ordinary navigation, interaction, focus, assertion, page, or locale failures
become cell results while later safe cells continue. Cleanup runs for every
created context. Loss of browser authority is an unsafe stop: remaining cells
are recorded as unexecuted rather than silently omitted.

## In-Memory Authentication Profiles

```json
{
  "authProfiles": [{
    "name": "admin",
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/sign-in",
    "actions": [
      {"action": "fill", "selector": "#password", "value": "secret supplied by caller"},
      {"action": "click", "selector": "#sign-in"}
    ],
    "waitFor": {"responseUrl": "**/session", "selector": "[data-auth-ready]"}
  }],
  "targets": [{"url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin", "authProfile": "admin"}]
}
```

Each profile bootstraps once. Its Playwright storage state remains in memory and
seeds a fresh context for every bound cell. Profile failure affects only bound
cells. Action values and storage contents never enter config evidence, reports,
logs, progress, or cache entries.

## Development Selection And Cache

Fast affected-cell runs are explicit development evidence:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "changedPaths": ["src/accounts/AccountList.tsx"],
    "cache": {
      "directory": "/explicit/external/formal-ui-cache",
      "dataRevision": "fixture-snapshot-2026-09-01",
      "mode": "read-write"
    }
  }
}
```

Changed paths are repository-relative and match declared `reviewInputs`. All
states and viewports for an affected target group are selected. Any unmapped
path expands to the full plan instead of risking a false subset. The full
declared plan still must fit `maxPageCount` before selection.

The cache directory must already exist, be absolute, external to `repoRoot`,
and contain no symlinked path components. Cache reuse additionally requires an
expected source binding and valid review-input fingerprint. Keys bind verifier,
browser, privacy-safe config, secret-value digest, source, intent, data
revision, route, state, and viewport. Only successful cells with matched source
identity and complete masked screenshot evidence are written atomically.
Corrupt or symlinked entries are rejected and rerun. The cache is never a
hidden baseline and never makes a run readiness-eligible.

## Theme And Palette Rules

- Every target/state declares `light`, `dark`, or `mixed` theme intent.
- WCAG 2.2 AA text thresholds are critical: 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for
  rendered large text. Use `allowContrast` or
  `data-ui-allow-contrast="reason"` only for a documented inactive,
  incidental, decorative, or logo exception.
- A 24×24 visible-surface sample blocks a large contradiction of declared
  light/dark intent. Use `themeExceptions` or
  `data-ui-theme-exception="reason"` for an intentional local exception.
- High-chroma surface coverage, four or more prominent accent-hue clusters,
  gradients, media, and unmeasurable compositing are warnings for screenshot
  review. They are not automatic claims that a palette is ugly.

## Review Inputs And Evidence

- `repoRoot` is explicit and canonical. Each `reviewInputs` entry is a
  repository-relative regular file or directory. Missing, empty, external, or
  symlinked inputs fail coverage.
- Inputs identify only UI code, styles, tokens, fonts, assets, and genuinely
  shared presentation files that can change that target/state. Do not include
  the entire repository merely to avoid mapping ownership.
- Every checked cell produces a redacted initial-viewport PNG and full-page
  PNG. Native control values, placeholders, selected labels, and declarative
  fill payloads are removed or masked. Add `screenshotMasks` with a reason for
  other sensitive regions.
- Screenshot SHA-256 values bind evidence integrity only. Pixel changes never
  enter the manual-review queue.

## Changed Visual Review

After the formal verifier and all other automatic tests finish, read only
`review-queue.json`. Open both images for each queued cell, record decisions in
a small JSON artifact, and finalize the immutable reviewed manifest:

```json
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "reviewCellKey": "key from review-queue.json",
      "decision": "pass",
      "note": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
python3 "$FORMAL_WEB_UI_SKILL_DIR/scripts/formal_web_ui_review.py" \
  --report /path/report.json \
  --queue /path/review-queue.json \
  --decisions /path/decisions.json \
  --out /path/manual-review.json
```

Use `gap` or `blocked` with a concrete note when appropriate. The finalizer
returns `1` while any decision blocks delivery and `2` for an invalid or
tampered evidence chain.

Supply a prior reviewed manifest explicitly on the next run:

```bash
node "$FORMAL_WEB_UI_SKILL_DIR/scripts/formal_web_ui_verify.mjs" \
  --config formal-web-ui.json \
  --review-against /path/prior-manual-review.json
```

Unchanged prior passes and gaps are carried without reopening their images;
gaps remain blocking. New cells and changed review-input or intent fingerprints
enter the queue. When a previously reviewed cell is deliberately removed,
declare its key and reason under `reviewRemovedCells`; silent removal fails
coverage.
