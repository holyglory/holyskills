| Case review | Case Review | raw tool result block | rare-under-5-percent | supports debugging | rare | product requirement |

## UI Handoff Constraints

Use screenshots and rendered-state evidence to verify the case review surface.

## Feature Inventory
Features: status badges, warning flags, expandable rows, messages, result blocks.

## UI Element Inventory
UI elements: badge, flag, row, message, result block.

## Implementation Expectations
Handlers, state, persistence, validation, and permissions must exist.

## Test Expectations
Acceptance criteria, fixture, visual test, and accessibility checks must exist.

## App Idea

Product promise: help operators understand live metrics quickly.
Primary users: operations analysts.
Primary value: high-priority metrics are available before configuration.

## Journey Inventory

| Journey | User | Frequency | Importance | Risk if broken | Entry point | Success state |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| Review live metrics | operations analyst | high | high | high | /metrics | user can decide current metric status |

## Journey Decision Model

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metrics Dashboard | understand current live metrics quickly | decide current metric status | high-priority metric list, latest chart, latest update time | threshold warning and stale-data warning | inspect metric details | display filter and advanced settings configuration | none |

## Information Relevance Inventory

| Journey | Surface | Item | Relevance | Why it matters | Condition/frequency | Evidence source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Review live metrics | Metrics Dashboard | display filter | secondary-occasional | helps refine the view | occasional | product requirement |
| Review live metrics | Metrics Dashboard | advanced settings configuration | rare-under-5-percent | supports admin tuning | rare | product requirement |

## UI Handoff Constraints

| Surface | Decisions the UI must support | Required evidence for UI audit | States to verify | Mockups/screenshots/assets | Unconfirmed assumptions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metrics Dashboard | decide current metric status using live metrics, chart, and warning state | screenshot, DOM viewport measurement, and visual audit evidence | loading, empty, error, stale-data warning, threshold warning | metrics-dashboard mockup | none |

## Feature Inventory

Features and capabilities: metrics summary, live chart, inspect metric details, display filter, advanced settings configuration, threshold warning, empty state, loading state, and error recovery.

## UI Element Inventory

Required UI elements: metric cards, chart, inspect button, display filter control, settings menu, threshold banner, loading state, empty state, error toast, and retry button.

## Implementation Expectations

Handlers, API data path, persistence, validation, permission check, and state change behavior must be defined for the metric detail action, display filter, settings menu, and retry path.

## Test Expectations

Acceptance criteria, unit test, component test, e2e, visual test, fixture, and test mode expectations must cover metrics loading, empty data, threshold warning, filter persistence, permission denial, error retry, and constrained-screen journey usefulness.

## UI Handoff Constraints

Use the UI implementation audit with a mobile screenshot, mockup, and DOM/native viewport measurement to confirm the rendered surface supports the live-metric decision and keeps conditional settings from overwhelming that decision path.

## Interaction And Metadata Model

| Surface | Element or metadata | User intent | Interaction target | Feedback/detail access | Stability/accessibility expectation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metrics Dashboard | threshold warning badge | decide whether status needs action | badge and keyboard focus | hover/focus hint and click popover detail | stable position, accessible name, no scrollbar collision, popover closes on outside click or focus loss after idle timeout |
| Metrics Dashboard | latest update timestamp | know data freshness | not interactive | passive visible metadata | timestamp is not selectable message content |

Features: urgent case indicator, warning count, raw signal evidence, owner metadata, retry.
